Let all these things just sort of happen. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it.",

  {
    title: "We don't have anything but happy trees here. ",
    body: "Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be.",

    body: "You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun.",

If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted.",

    title: "Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective.",
    body: "If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. By now you should be quite happy about what's happening here. Imagination is the key to painting. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things.",

  {
    title: "Just a happy little shadow that lives in there.",
    body: "Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. We'll do another happy little painting.",
